Analysis of police officers redeployment in 2017

This repository contains the scripts generated to analyze publicly available data on crime incidents in the city of San Francisco. Steven Raphael & I are preparing a paper based n this analysis: The Effect of Redeploying Police Officers from Plain Clothes Special Assignment to Uniformed Foot-beat Patrols on Street Crime. 

Data for this project are incident level crime reports collected by SFPD and available at https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry. The dataset includes incidents occurring from calendar years 2003 through mid-year 2018.  Our analysis makes use of the incident data for the year 2003 through 2017.
